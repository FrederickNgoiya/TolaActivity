Terminology:
 - active target (also 'complete' or 'reporting'):
    a time-aware target whose time period is completed as of Now() OR
    a LOP target in a program whose reporting period is over as of Now() OR
    a MID_END/EVENT target with at least one Result assigned to it
- reporting indicator:
    an indicator with at least one active target
- lop_<field>_progress
    "progress" here means "including only active targets" - actual values or target values combined for active targets

Business Rules:
- targets:
    each period's target is exactly what is in the target field
    LOP target: (currently a user-editable field, but will be calculated in the future as):
        PERCENTAGE: latest target
        NON-PERCENTAGE: sum of all targets
- results:
    combine with the following logic:
        PERCENTAGE: latest result value in that target period
        CUMULATIVE NUMBER: sum of all results up to and including those in that target period
        NONCUMULATIVE NUMBER: sum of all results in that target period only
